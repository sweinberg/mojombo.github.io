# Diving into the Art of Data Corruption

I've been exploring the use of data corruption, of both image and audio files, to create the distorted, pixelated artwork and music known as *glitch art*. Also called *databending*, the art form calls for the perversion of computer data using any of the following methods:

* **Reinterpretation**—converting a file from one medium to another.
* **Sonification**—the reinterpretation of non-audio data into audio data.
* **Forced errors**—forcing an application or piece of hardware to fail in the hopes that it will behave unexpectedly or the data will corrupt.
* **Incorrect editing**—editing a file using software/hardware intended for a different form of data.

I found that the easiest method of databending was **incorrect editing**. To do this, I popped open some sample image files into a hex editor and removed some random tidbits of data. Once saved, the newly glitched-out images can be viewed. My attempts did not yield the results I was hoping for, but creating them was an interesting process.
